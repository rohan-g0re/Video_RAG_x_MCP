### **Product Requirements Document: MCP-Driven Local Video RAG System**

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the requirements for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for video content. The system will operate locally, allowing a user to specify a directory for video uploads. It will leverage a Model Context Protocol (MCP) architecture to connect with a user's existing Cursor Pro subscription, enabling access to powerful AI models for processing while maintaining a lightweight local footprint and zero additional cost. Users will interact with the system via a Command-Line Interface (CLI) to receive precise, context-aware answers and video clips.

**2. Objectives & Goals**

*   **Primary Objective:** To enable users to perform efficient, natural language search and question-answering over a local collection of video files.
*   **Key Goal 1 (Intelligent Retrieval):** The system must understand complex natural language queries to provide accurate text-based answers derived from both the spoken content and visual context of the videos.
*   **Key Goal 2 (Automated Clip Generation):** The system must automatically identify and extract specific video segments in response to descriptive user queries, providing a ready-to-view clip of the relevant moment.
*   **Key Goal 3 (Lightweight & Zero-Cost):** The system must operate with minimal local resource usage (target < 2.5GB RAM) and incur no additional costs by utilizing the AI models available through the user's Cursor Pro subscription via MCP.

**3. Target Users & Roles**

*   **End-User (e.g., Content Analyst, Researcher):** The primary user who interacts with the system to find information.
    *   **Needs:** To quickly find specific moments, quotes, or visual information within large video libraries without manual searching.
    *   **Actions:** Formulating natural language queries, executing searches via the CLI, reviewing text-based answers, and viewing the automatically generated video clips.
*   **System Operator (The user setting up the system):** The user responsible for the setup and maintenance of the system.
    *   **Needs:** A straightforward installation process with minimal hardware requirements and reliable, automated processing of video files.
    *   **Actions:** Configuring the source video directory, running the ingestion command, and monitoring system status via console output.

**4. Core Features for MVP**

*   **F1: MCP-Driven Processing Pipeline**
    *   The system will automatically detect new videos in a specified directory.
    *   It will process them using a combination of a lightweight local model for initial transcription and Cursor Pro's advanced models (via MCP) for deeper analysis.

*   **F2: Visual Analysis via MCP**
    *   The system will extract representative frames from each video and send them to Cursor Pro's vision model (GPT-4V) via the MCP bridge.
    *   It will generate and store timestamped textual descriptions of the visual content (scenes, objects, actions).

*   **F3: Local Vector Indexing**
    *   The system will use a lightweight, local vector database to create a searchable index from the transcribed audio and visual descriptions.
    *   This index will link all data back to the source video file and precise timestamps.

*   **F4: RAG-based Answer Generation**
    *   The system will use Cursor Pro's language models (via MCP) to enhance user queries for better search results.
    *   It will synthesize the retrieved information from the index into a coherent, human-readable text answer.

*   **F5: On-Demand Video Clip Generation**
    *   Based on the search results, the system will identify the exact start and end timestamps for the most relevant moment.
    *   It will programmatically trim the original source video to create a new, standalone clip and provide the user with the file path.

*   **F6: Command-Line Interface**
    *   The user will interact with the system through simple CLI commands for setup, ingestion, and querying.
    *   Example commands: `video-rag setup`, `video-rag ingest`, `video-rag query "your question"`.

**5. Future Scope**

*   **GUI:** Develop a simple Graphical User Interface for easier querying and viewing of results and clips.
*   **Enhanced Visual Analysis:** Incorporate more advanced capabilities like face recognition, object tracking, and on-screen text recognition (OCR).
*   **Conversational Search:** Allow for follow-up questions that retain the context of the previous query.
*   **API Access:** Provide an API for programmatic access to the system, allowing integration with other tools.
*   **Enterprise Features:** Introduce multi-user support, shared libraries, and advanced analytics.

**6. User Journey Example**

*   **A. System Operator: Setup and Ingestion**
    1.  The Operator installs the system and runs `video-rag setup --video-dir /path/to/videos` to configure the source directory. The system confirms its connection to Cursor Pro via MCP.
    2.  The Operator adds a new file, `interview_2024.mp4`, to the directory.
    3.  They run the command: `video-rag ingest`
    4.  The CLI displays progress: `Processing interview_2024.mp4: Transcribing... Analyzing visuals via MCP... Indexing complete.`

*   **B. End-User: Finding Information and a Clip**
    1.  The User opens a terminal and executes their query: `video-rag query "find the discussion about market trends"`
    2.  The system performs a local search, enhances the query via MCP, finds a match in `interview_2024.mp4` from timestamp `14:32` to `16:45`, and generates a response.
    3.  The terminal displays the output:
        ```
        Answer: A discussion about market trends was found in 'interview_2024.mp4' from 14:32 to 16:45, covering Q4 patterns and growth predictions.

        Clip saved to: /path/to/output/clip_20241027_143200.mp4
        ```
    4.  The User can now play the generated clip to instantly view the relevant segment.

**7. Tech Stack**

*This section describes the types of components and technologies required, without specifying brand names or particular frameworks, to maintain flexibility.*
